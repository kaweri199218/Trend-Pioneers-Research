This growth is driven by the increasing demand for minimally invasive cosmetic procedures, as well as technological advancements in laser equipment that offer enhanced precision, safety, and efficacy for skin treatments, hair removal, and tattoo removal. Rising consumer preference for non-surgical cosmetic procedures, particularly in emerging markets, has also contributed to the market expansion. Moreover, the growing aging population, who seek anti-aging and skin rejuvenation treatments, further propels the market growth.

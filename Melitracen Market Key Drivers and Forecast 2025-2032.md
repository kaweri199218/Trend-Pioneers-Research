The growth of the market is primarily driven by increasing demand for effective treatments for anxiety, depression, and other related disorders. As mental health awareness rises globally, particularly in emerging markets, the adoption of Melitracen as a first-line treatment for certain mood disorders is increasing. In addition, the growing prevalence of psychiatric conditions and a rising number of prescriptions contribute significantly to the expansion of the market. Another key factor driving market growth is the ongoing research and development aimed at improving the efficacy of antidepressant and anxiolytic drugs. Increased government focus on mental health care infrastructure and funding, as well as advancements in pharmaceutical formulations, are expected to further fuel market demand. Moreover, the rising geriatric population, particularly in developed regions, is another important trend contributing to market growth, as Melitracen is frequently used to treat anxiety and related conditions in older adults.
